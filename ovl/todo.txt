Custom Functions for Multiple Selected Rows

Configuration:
- A "TableOnlyMobile" - visibility (Can be used to display aggregated data of a table only on mobile. Details are then visible as usual in detail view)

Field Hooks:
- Maybe just use a Field_XX Hook instead of using the Field Key as well
- Could simplify styling Hooks which sould be applied for all Columns(Fields)

Hooks:
- Hook FormEditLabelStyle (Provides all the fields of a row analogous to validateField)
- Hook FormEditControlStyle(...)
- Hook FormTableRowStyle (Provides all the fields of a row analogous to validateField)
- Hook FormTableHeaderStyle(...)

- Hook Field_%_TableRowRender. A Custom Renderer for row field in tableview
- Hook Field_%_TableHeaderRender. A Custom Renderer for header field in tableview
- Hook Field_%_DetailviewLabelRender. A Custom Renderer for row field in tableview
- Hook Field_%_DetailviewRender. A Custom Renderer for header field in tableview

- Hook Field_%_EditRender. A Custom Renderer for field in edit. Must fire ovlfocussout and ovlchange events to trigger validation
- Hook FormViewRender. A Custom Renderer for the full Detail view content (Maybe prepare a codesandbox to test those...)

- Hook Field_%_Link. If present the view will display a underline which can be clicked and then this hook gets called

Controls:
- type Checkbox
- type Link
- type Image

Offline Save/Delete:
- if  a post (all xhr calls are in the same post action) fails (try catch?) then the payload of that post action will be saved somehow
  its important to save those post payloads into a list sorted by execution time (also hand over that execution time then on execution. it can be used as the eg. Docdate when creating documents)
  added rows should get a key like ovl_offline+uuid and related childs added can be tracked because of next feature

Change Tracking:
- long poll which can be configured with tablenames to track
  the result of the long poll will be pushed back to a state object
  now components interested in server changes just need to track this state
