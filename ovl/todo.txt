Controls:
- type Checkbox

Offline Save/Delete:
- if  a post (all xhr calls are in the same post action) fails (try catch?) then the payload of that post action will be saved somehow
  its important to save those post payloads into a list sorted by execution time (also hand over that execution time then on execution. it can be used as the eg. Docdate when creating documents)
  added rows should get a key like ovl_offline+uuid and related childs added can be tracked because of next feature

Change Tracking:
- long poll which can be configured with tablenames to track
  the result of the long poll will be pushed back to a state object
  now components interested in server changes just need to track this state
